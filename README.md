# CODE REFACTORING TASK

In this task, our goal is to refactor an existing website for a marketing agency to enhance its accessibility. 
This is a crucial aspect of web development, ensuring that the website is inclusive and can be easily accessed by 
people with disabilities using assistive technologies.

## Task Overview
Web accessibility is an important consideration for businesses. It opens up your website to a wider audience and 
improves its search engine ranking. The goal of this task is to refactor the existing code, adhering 
to specific accessibility criteria provided in the acceptance criteria section.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

The website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:
* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

## Getting Started
Clone the Repository of the challenge from GitHub:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```
## Navigate to the Project Directory on your computer:
```bash
cd module-1-challenge
```
## Add the starter code to the new repo on your computer and open on an Code Editor e.g VS Code.
```bash
code [folder name]
```

## Review Starter Code:
* Familiarize yourself with the existing code provided.

## Make Improvements:

* Follow the acceptance criteria to implement necessary changes for accessibility.
* Ensure all links are functioning correctly.
* Optimize the CSS by consolidating selectors and properties.
* Organize CSS to follow the semantic structure of HTML elements.
* Include comments before each element or section in the CSS for clarity.

## Testing

## To successfully complete this challenge, ensure that the following criteria are met:
### Accessible HTML:
   * Use semantic HTML elements appropriately.
   * Ensure a logical structure independent of styling.
### Functional Links:
   * Verify that all links are functioning correctly.
### Optimized CSS:
   * Consolidate CSS selectors and properties.
   * Organize CSS to follow the semantic structure of HTML elements.
   * Include comments for clarity before each element or section.
### Scout Rule:
   * Follow the Scout Ruleâ€”leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

## Commit and push changes to repository:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push origin main
```
## Deploy your webpage:

Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.
On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the
`main` branch as your source.
Navigate to `<your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name>` and you will find that your new webpage has gone live!
For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be 
`<lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>`.
